## 说在前面
欢迎光顾本项目:joy:这是一个可以用来在线查询单词和生成个性单词本的小软件，基于QT/C++。开发动机很单纯——苦于备考TOEFL和GRE，借着期末作业要做数据库相关的小项目，画了个E-R图就开撸了:stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:。目前是版本1.0，比较粗糙，代码也没有重构，写得比较丑。基本实现了查词和单词本功能，不过应当有更多的细节和功能可以加入。本人在空余之时会尝试改进，也欢迎dalao（尤其是备战TG的同胞们呐）进行改进和重构:trollface:。

## Preface
Welcome to this project:joy:This is a tiny application, based on QT/C++, for online word searching and personal word lists generating. The motivation for development is quite simple——suffering from preparing for the TOEFL&GRE tests, as taking advantages of database-related project by the end of the term, I decided to designed an E-R map and began to code:stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:. The current version is 1.0, which is just a coarse outline without codes reorganization and everything looks sort of ugly. Basically I realized the query section and the word list section. However, it should have been more details and stronger functions in it. I will try to improve it in my spare time and the more important is, welcome the excellent YOU to join me and try to make it:trollface:!
